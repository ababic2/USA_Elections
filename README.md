## Tech Stack  

- **ASP.NET Core MVC** â€“ Web framework for the application  
- **Services Layer** â€“ Handles all database and file interactions, ensuring a clean architecture  

## Database Design  

The database currently consists of the following tables:  

- **Candidate** â€“ Stores information about each election candidate  
- **Constituency** â€“ Contains data about constituencies  
- **Vote** â€“ Keeps track of votes  

This modular design makes it easy to add new records or expand the schema as needed.

## Validation  

Incorrect entries are automatically separated into a dedicated error file.  
This ensures that invalid records do not get inserted into the database and makes error handling more transparent.  

## Features  

- CRUD operations for election data  
- Clean architecture with services  
- Validation of input data with error logging  
- Scalable database design  

## Future Improvements  

- Adding richer candidate details (e.g. biography, political history)  
- Incorporating additional geographic data (population, demographics)  
- More advanced reporting and visualization tools
